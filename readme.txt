Advanced block based pop-up solution.

== Description ==

Need popups to grab your users' attention? Marketing call-to-actions that open on scroll, timer, click, matched referer or even hover?
Multiple popups on one page? This plugin has it all. It provides styling consistent with core block editor blocks plus additional features.

= Why choose Makeiteasy Popup? =

❗ Unlike some other plugins, Makeiteasy Popup integrates seamlessly with WordPress,
feeling like a native, built-in WP block. It’s lightweight and self-sufficient,
without the heavy burden of a large blocks library.
It relies on a single tiny dependency - micromodal.js - with a combined total of only 10 kB of JavaScript ❗

= Key Features =

- 🥇 **Feature-Rich** and **free**.
- 🥈 **Fully Open Source**: Including the block source code. Fork and adjust as needed.
- 🥉 **Developer friendly**: Hooks for modifications and unopinionated starting CSS.
- ⏲️ **Future-Proof Compatibility**: Guaranteed compatibility with future WordPress versions.

== Installation ==

= From block editor: =

Search for 'makeiteasy popup' in the block editor when adding a new block via the '+' sign in the top bar.

= Standard Installation: =

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly or upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/makeiteasy-popup` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Known limitations ==

Currently, opening several modal popups simultaneously is impossible due to the limitations of the Micromodal.js library.
Future versions will replace this library with the native `Dialog` HTML element, including automatic migration for existing popups.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the 'CSS Selector' field work? =

The CSS Selector field, used in the "open on scroll," "hover," and "click" options, allows you to specify a CSS selector to identify the element that will trigger the popup. The selector can be of any complexity, but it must uniquely select an element. If multiple elements match the selector, only the first one will trigger the popup.
To define the trigger in practice, go to the advanced section of the desired block and specify an anchor keyword or an additional CSS class. For an anchor, use `#` as the prefix, and for a class, use `.` (dot). For example, if your anchor is `myelement`, you would use `#myelement` in the CSS Selector field.

= How does "Show again after days" function? =

When you enter number other than 0 under "Additional rules" section, in "Show again after days" textbox, the rule is set to initially open the popup. After reloading the page, popup will open only upon selected period in days expires.

== Developers ==

= Github repository =

[https://github.com/Lovor01/makeiteasy-popup](https://github.com/Lovor01/makeiteasy-popup)

= Changing the Close button =

Using Javascript:

`
import { ReactComponent as CloseIcon } from '../assets/close-x.svg';
addFilter( 'makeiteasy-closeButtonIcon', 'makeiteasy/makeiteasy-popup/close-icon', () => (<CloseIcon />) );
`

If you customize button this way and you already have posts(or pages) with popup block,
on post reopening the message "This block contains unexpected or invalid content." will be presented.
In such case choose "Attempt to repair block" and if it looks good, save post.

Using PHP:

`
add_action( 'render_block_makeiteasy/popup', function($content) {
  $svg = file_get_contents( __DIR__ . '/path_to_file/close-button-dark.svg' );
  return preg_replace(
    '~(<button.*class="makeiteasy-popup-close".*?>).*(</button>)~m',
    "$1$svg$2",
    $content
    );
} );
`

= Attaching Code to Modal Events =

Custom events 'makeiteasy/openModal' and 'makeiteasy/closeModal' are fired on modal open and close.
